# Why are so few Black professors tenured? Texas has made little progress despite promises of change

Last summerâ€™s protests and racial reckoning led many universities to reaffirm a commitment to diversity, but that commitment has been slow to materialize. In the last 10 years, Texas universities made few strides to increase the number of Black tenured faculty, according to an analysis by *The Dallas Morning News*.

In 2011, 4.13% of all tenured professors in Texas were Black. By 2019, 4.64% were Black.

Almost no four-year public or private higher education institution in Texas has more than 9% Black tenured professors, according to the most recently available federal data. Historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, in Texas with tenure all have a rate of at least 40%.
